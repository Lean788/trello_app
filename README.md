# 3rd challenge [GeeksHubs Academy]
## _Trello app_



The challenge is to create an APP similar to [Trello].

## Deploy

This app is deployed in the next [link].

## Features

- Once the lists have been created, it should allow us to create the tasks internally.
- We must have enough tools to be able to eliminate tasks and lists.
- As in Trello, we must organize the lists by columns, and internally the tasks must also be able to organize them internally.


## Assessment Requirements

## Observations
Some details need to be polished in layout components. They will be corrected soon. The challenge has been very intense and exciting. I have certainly learned a lot about the power of React from this practice.
